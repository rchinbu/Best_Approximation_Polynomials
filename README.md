# The best degree five polynomial approximation to Sine

For this project I created a file that describes a vector space of polynomials and an inner product on that space that integrates the difference of two polynomials over the interval -pi to pi. Then I converted the usual basis of R^5 to an orthogonal basis using Graham-Shmidt orthogonalization. I projected the sine function onto this basis to find the closest fifth degreee polynomial approximation to sine on the interval -pi to pi. 

The image shows that this function is a remarkably close approximation.
